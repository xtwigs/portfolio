# Introduction

The task of text simplification (TS) is usually posed as: from a source
sentence, rewrite it in a way that makes it easier to read, using
techniques ranging from lexical simplification to reformulating the
grammatical structure of the sentence, paraphrasing wherever need to be.
The purpose of this task is to facilitate the reading and understanding
of possibly complicated texts for readers who suffer from cognitive
disabilities, namely aphasia [@article], dyslexia
[@10.1145/2461121.2461126], autism [@evans-etal-2014-evaluation], or
even second language learners [@10.5555/3016387.3016433].

Furthermore, with governments passing legislation requiring legal and
public texts to be available in simplified language [@Maass2020], this
field is gaining more and more traction as suddenly public entities are
forced to translate their entire available information base to a
simplified language.

Given that this is an active area of research, our initial focus was on
emulating key publications and, possibly, try to build on their work and
improve it. During the course of the semester, we have focused mainly on
general rewriting of the inputs provided through the fine-tuning of
large language models, controlling this rewriting through explicit
control tokens and, in a more narrow scope, identifying and replacing
possibly lexically complex words in a pre- or post-processing step.

We achieved moderate success in this task as we got close to the state
of the art (43.05 SARI [@xu-etal-2016-optimizing] on the ASSET
[@alva-manchego-etal-2020-asset] dataset). Nonetheless, there is still
definitive room for improvement as some topics were left unexplored
either due to lack of time, or lack of compute power required to train
these large models. Throughout the report, and in a following section on
future work, we thoroughly discuss what we consider the bottlenecks in
our system to be, and possible ways to tackle them.

# Related Work

In this section, we describe some of the research conducted. Mainly, in
the Sentence Simplification, Controllable Text Generation and Lexical
Simplification areas.

## Sentence Simplification

Sentence simplification can be seen as a monolingual machine translation
task, where models are trained with aligned pairs of sentences obtained,
for example, from Wikipedia articles and their corresponding Simple
Wikipedia versions [@zhu-etal-2010; @Wubben-etal-2012].

To this purpose, there was some focus on Statistical Machine Translation
models [@zhu-etal-2010] but those have since been overcome by large
neural models. Among several others: @Nisioi1-2017-neural used a vanilla
recurrent neural network for text simplification;
@zhang-lapata-2017-sentence combined RNNs and reinforcement learning;
@https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1810.11193 introduced the transformer
architecture for TS and integrated it with a paraphrase dataset
[@Pavlick-2016-PPDB]; @Dong-2019-EditNTS presented EditNTS, a
reinforcement learning model that learns ADD, DELETE and KEEP operations
to simplify text.

## Controllable Text Generation

In the last few years, controllable text generation with conditional
training of Seq2Seq models has been applied to different NLP tasks such
as summarization [@https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1711.05217],
politeness in machine translation [@Sennrich-2016], sentence compression
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1809.02669; @Mallinson-2018], along
with others.

In the text simplification task, @Scarton-2018 pioneered this idea of
controllable tokens to generate simplified sentences by embedding a
grade level token into a Seq2Seq model. ACCESS
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1910.02677] leveraged a similar
approach by conditioning the sentences on number of characters,
character-level Levenshtein similarity, word frequency and syntactic
complexity.

Furthermore, building on ACCESS,
@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.00352 presented MUSS
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.00352] an unsupervised
multilingual model that fine-tunes a BART language model instead of the
original Transformer architecture. Recently,
@sheang-saggion-2021-controllable reiterated this idea, but with the
newer T5 [@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1910.10683] model and an
additional token encoding the number of words ratio between sentences,
becoming the current state of the art.

## Lexical Simplification

Lexical simplification (LS) is the task of identifying complex words and
finding the best candidates to replace them. Early studies on Complex
Word Identification (CWI) usually identified complex words based on some
word frequency threshold [@Biran-2011], word length [@Bautista-2009], or
even attempting to simplify all words [@Thomas-2012]. However,
@Horn-2014 showed that this last approach may ignore a large portion of
complex words due to its inability to find simpler alternatives.

Moreover, as @Shardlow-2013 states that the simplify-all approach might
result in distorted meanings and the more resource-intensive
threshold-based approach does not necessarily perform better, novel
approaches have been presented [@gooding-kochmar-2019-complex] to
perform CWI conditioned on the context words lie in, in a sequence
modelling fashion.

Detailing complex word replacement, previously rule-based systems
usually replace an identified word by it most frequent synonym in
WordNet [@Thomas-2012]. However, more recent approaches are using
contextualized word vectors [@Qiang-etal-2020], leveraging the power of
the powerful neural models currently available.

# Datasets

Fortunately, when considering text simplification for English sentences,
there exists a large amount of data publicly available, mainly due to
the existence of a Simple English version of Wikipedia[^1] and
educational article sources such as Newsela[^2].

Besides, there have been numerous efforts aligning these articles,
providing the research community with high quality simplification
datasets for the English language. Among them, we have WikiLarge
[@zhang-lapata-2017-sentence] and WikiAuto
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.02324] which differ in the way
they were constructed and overall size.

Additionally, in order to augment the training dataset, we made use of a
paraphrase dataset entitled OpusParcus
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1809.06142]: it uses differently
authored subtitles for movies and TV shows, resulting in aligned
paraphrases for scenes with the same meaning.

Moreover, there are two test datasets that are commonly discussed in the
literature: TurkCorpus [@xu-etal-2016-optimizing] and the ASSET
[@alva-manchego-etal-2020-asset] dataset. These last two source the same
original sentences, but resort to different simplification techniques in
the crowdsourced references they provide. While TurkCorpus only allows
for rewriting the original sentence, ASSET is less restrictive and makes
it possible to delete expressions or split the ideas over several
sentences.

On the other hand, for the lexical simplification approach, we utilized
the English dataset from the Complex Word Identification 2018 Shared
Task [@Yimam-2018], called CWIG3G2 [@yimam-etal-2017-cwig3g2].

Concluding, in table [1](#dataset_sizes){reference-type="ref"
reference="dataset_sizes"}, we can take note of each dataset's size.

## Newsela

Featuring the Newsela dataset in our project would have been an
excellent addition, since it consists of educational articles with
professional simplifications. However, Newsela is a corporate entity and
their data is not publicly available. We tried to get access to it but,
unfortunately, we didn't receive a reply.

# Evaluation of our system

In order to evaluate our models, we rely on three evaluation metrics:
SARI, FKGL and BLEU. We compute them using EASSE
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1908.04567], a simplification
evaluation library in Python.

## SARI

SARI [@xu-etal-2016-optimizing] compares system output against both
references and the input sentences. It measures the goodness of words
that are added, deleted and kept by the systems comparing the output of
the simplification model to multiple references and the original
sentence, using both n-gram precision and recall.

So far, SARI is the most commonly adopted metric for text simplification
in English, and we use it as a reference score of the overall
performance.

## FKGL

In order to measure the readability of our systems, we use FKGL
[@Kincaid1975DerivationON]. It is computed as a linear combination of
sentence length and the number of syllables per word.

Although FKGL does not take into account grammaticality and meaning
preservation [@Wubben-2012], it is one of the mostly used evaluation
metrics for text simplification in English (only). However, due to this
limitation it should not be used alone as an evaluation metric.

## BLEU

Usually utilized as a metric to evaluate machine translation systems,
BLEU [@papineni-etal-2002-bleu], is an N-gram based metric that is
supposed to correlate with meaning preservation

Although it has been reported that BLEU doesn't necessarily correlate
with the quality of simplifications
([@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2104.07560; @sulem-etal-2018-semantic]),
we found that we should still report it in order to compare our model
with other existing work.

# Fine-Tuning Language Models for Simplification

Similar to a baseline step, we decided to train a basic Seq2Seq model
with attention [@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1409.0473]. However, as
it did not amount to good or even promising results, possibly due to
implementation related problems, work in this direction was halted.
Still, we report this model in our results under the name _Baseline_.
Furthermore, for our initial experiments we settled on a subset of the
larger WikiAuto dataset as we found it to be enough (circa 50000
sentences) for a proof-of-concept demonstration.

As a next step, and with a large amount of inspiration from the MUSS
paper [@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.00352], we set out to
fine-tune a BART [@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1910.13461] model on
the subset of WikiAuto we have mentioned above. We resorted to the
HuggingFace[^3] `transformers` package, which has all the necessary
tools to build and fine-tune our models. Specifically, we have made use
of the `facebook/bart-base` model which is adequate to our computing
power: the training portion was conducted through an instance of Google
Colab Pro[^4] as neither of us have a machine capable of training at
this model/dataset scale.

From there, we had built a model with a somewhat reasonable behavior,
achieving a 38.59 SARI score on the ASSET dataset (more details and
comparisons on our all of our model results will be discussed in a
future section).

In addition to BART, we also experimented with the T5
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1910.10683] model, which should have
displayed relatively better results. However, we encountered some
overfitting issues in the fine-tuning procedure and tried some known
fixes (freezing layers, dropout, etc...) to no avail.

## Ranking candidate sentences

Finally, one other aspect to consider optimizing when it comes to these
large language models generation ability, is that they are able to
output several candidate sentences. With the use of beam-search to
search over the most likely tokens, the model is able to keep track of
what sentences observe the highest likelihood and drop them dynamically
if a new, more probable, candidate arises. But then, how should we rank
these candidates and output a singular, most simple sentence?

One simple heuristic is to compute the FKGL metric over the candidates
and return the lowest score, which should indicate the simpler sentence
overall. However, this completely disregards the semantic meaning in
each sentence. In @https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1901.10746, machine
translation metrics such as METEOR [@banerjee-lavie-2005-meteor] and
smoothed BLEU [@lin-och-2004-automatic] showed the largest correlation
with meaning preservation. Furthermore, we would want to encourage
grammatical structure simplification, which can be measured through
SAMSA [@sulem-etal-2018-semantic]. Given all of these metrics and
aspects to optimize, we believe that a harmonic compromise between them
could be a plausible solution to the ranking problem.

On the other hand, we also experimented with another idea: drawing
inspiration from @https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2104.07560, we tried
using a question generation and answering framework on the source and
output sentence in order to evaluate their semantic meaning. For
simplification, this requires an adaptation of QuestEval
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2103.12693] that utilizes BERTScore
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1904.09675] instead of just plain F1
score of the provided answers. Since it's encouraged for the
simplification model to replace words with synonyms, we expect their
respective BERT [@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1810.04805] embeddings
to be similar.

What we found however is that we introduced a significant overhead in
our model's inference time and didn't gain much in terms of results.
Using a threshold approach on the candidate sentence's BERTScore, we
only managed to achieve the same SARI result we previously had once the
threshold had gotten low enough that the output was identical to the one
provided by FKGL ranking. Therefore, given the worst efficiency and poor
results, we disregarded this question generation/answering idea from our
final system.

## Paraphrase dataset augmentation

Closing the fine-tuning section, we should discuss another experiment we
have conducted: MUSS [@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.00352], one
of the most recent successful papers in the TS field, augments the
WikiLarge dataset with paraphrase data, easing the rewriting of phrases
and expressions. For their work, an unsupervised method was devised for
aligning sliding windows of text scraped from the web, computing a
similarity score between them for alignment. In the end, they
constructed an unsupervised paraphrase dataset of circa 1 million
samples, something unfeasible for us to reproduce.

However, instead of gathering the dataset ourselves, we tried to arrange
a paraphrase dataset and amplify WikiLarge with further sentence
rewriting examples. To this effect, we chose a subset of OpusParcus
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1809.06142], resulting in an augmented
training dataset of \~500000 aligned sentences. Following a large amount
of training time, this idea (which still sounds promising) failed to
produce an exciting SARI score, which prompted us to not investigate
further due to time constraints.

# Encoding Simplification With Explicit Tokens

In addition to general fine-tuning, we wanted to control sentence
simplification attributes using explicit control tokens. First, we
compute them for every sentence pair in the training set and inject the
ratio between source and target in the source sentence, such that the
model should learn to condition the output on the ratios. As a measure
of simplicity, we compute the following tokens:

**#Chars** `<c_xx>`: the number of characters ratio between source and
target sentences. This control token provides information about sentence
compression.

**LevSim** `<lev_xx>`: normalized character-level Levenshtein similarity
[@Levenshtein-1966] between the source and target. Quantifies how
different the target is to the source sentence.

**WordRank** `<rank_xx>`: inverse frequency order of all words in the
target divided by that of the source. Word frequency are indicators of
word complexity.

**DepTree** `<dep_xx>`: maximum depth of the dependency tree of the
target divided by that of the source. This token should provide
information about syntactic complexity.

**#Words** `<rat_xx>`: number of words ratio between source sentence and
target sentence. The number of words in the target divided by that of
the source.

At inference time, we condition the generation by choosing the values
most suitable to the degree of simplification required.

## Hyperparameter search

At inference time, we have to choose fixed ratios that maximize the
simplicity for the audience (measured by the SARI score). To this
effect, we handcrafted different possible values for each token and
tried out combinations between them. It is easy to see how this leads to
an exponential runtime complexity, which is something we couldn't afford
to run several times. Concluding, after trying out several combinations
on the ASSET dataset, we settled on the values shown in table
[2](#token_comb){reference-type="ref" reference="token_comb"}.

:::

## Finding new tokens

In addition to the tokens described in
@sheang-saggion-2021-controllable, we explored new token ideas that
could possibly increase our overall SARI score (42.94 originally). The
following options were tested:

**#Splits**: the number of sentences ratio between source and target.
This should provide information about the model's ability to split a
long sentence and generating short sentences. Result: $\mathbf{42.43}$.

**Average word length**: the average word length ratio between the words
in source and test sentences. Provides information about word
compression. Result: $\mathbf{42.475}$.

**#Syl**: average number of syllables per word ratio. Should help
readability. Result: $\mathbf{43.05}$.

More tokens could be tested, such as the number of polysyllables or the
proportion of edited, deleted and added words, for example. However,
these tokens would control the sentence compression and readability,
which are already controlled to some degree.

Finally, since only one of these tokens produced better results, we only
introduce the novel `n_syl` token and add it to our system.

## Ablation study

In this section, we study the impact that each token has over the
generated outputs. In figure
[\[fig:feature_corr\]](#fig:feature_corr){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:feature_corr"} we present how varying one feature in
isolation impacts the others. The displayed results stem from computing
these metrics over the ASSET test set outputs and averaging them over
all the sentences.

It is observed that some tokens are strongly correlated and that some
don't appear to have much influence on the majority of the outputs. For
example, if we consider character compression and word ratio,
Levenshtein similarity and dependency tree depth, we can clearly see how
they are correlated: shorter sentences should observe more rewriting and
fewer words overall, while also making an impact on the dependency tree
depth. On the other hand, tokens like word complexity and the number of
syllables don't seem to be having much effect, failing to vary the
output metric by much.

Nonetheless, overall, the tokens seem to be mostly behaving as expected,
showing more or less a linear increase if we look at each feature's data
separately.

# Lexical Simplification

Once the simplification model performed up to a decent standard, it was
time to experiment with explicit lexical simplification, setting up a
pipeline that tried to simplify any complex words. In turn, this implied
having two separate models: one for the identification of what words to
replace and one for the actual replacement.

## Complex Word Identification

Initially, as a baseline in identifying if a word is complex or not, we
tried out a simple heuristic: with access to the Zipf [@zipf_1949] word
frequencies in a large corpus of text, we could go over each word in the
provided input sentence and mark it as complex if its frequency was
below a certain threshold. Zipf's law is a power law model of how words
are distributed in a specific set of texts.

This approach works reasonably well, but it still has its shortcomings.
For example, it fails to consider a word's context, which was utilized
by @gooding-kochmar-2019-complex in order to improve the same CWI task.
Thus, following the paper's footsteps, we decided to model this problem
as a sequence classification task: we prefix a sentence (similar to the
token idea we have described in previous sections) with the word to be
labeled and let our model predict if it's complex or not.

Moreover, we should discuss what it entails for a word to be complex.
Most of the research available poses the CWI problem as a binary
classification task, but complexity is more fine-grained than a binary
label. A word isn't equally complex in the eyes of both a native and
non-native speaker. In this direction, in recent years there have been
some efforts in building regression models that are able to capture
these different views. This last task was the objective of the 2021
SemEval Lexical Complexity Prediction Shared Task
[@shardlow-etal-2021-semeval].

Similarly, we adapted our code to perform regression on the CWI dataset
from @yimam-etal-2017-cwig3g2 that used binary complex annotation for
our regression task: however, the dataset has the number of annotators
who found the word complex and the number of annotators overall, making
it possible for us to model the probability of a word being complex as
the regression target.

For the regressor, we resourced the DistilBert
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1910.01108] model available in the
`transformers` package and utilized it in a sequence classification
fashion but with a single class, effectively performing regression.
After fine-tuning on the binary CWI dataset, we had constructed a model
that performed quite well, achieving a Mean Average Error of 0.052 on
the test portion of the dataset, even visually evaluating it (see table
[\[table:cwi\]](#table:cwi){reference-type="ref"
reference="table:cwi"}), we can see that it behaves as expected. The
benefit of regression is that it allows us to set a threshold that
better models our data and, after some tweaking, we ended up settling
for a value of 0.2.

## Complex Word Replacement

First, we think that this portion of our system is its biggest
bottleneck. Unsurprisingly so, since our time-constrained solution is
very simple: after identifying which words to replace, we generate $n$
copies of the source sentence, where $n$ is equal to the amount of
complex words; from there we mask each complex word in a corresponding
sentence, leveraging DistilRoBERTa
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1910.01108] to predict the most likely
token given the context.

Now, this solution has some merit as the most likely word should be one
that occurs very frequently in the associated context and is, therefore,
simple. On the other hand, the reasoning behind replacing each word
individually is related to damage control, since there are no guarantees
that the substitute word is even remotely similar to the original.
Particularly, when replacing nouns, the most likely scenario is for the
model to find another, more common noun (e.g., neurosurgeon
$\rightarrow$ businessman).

Summarizing, this is not the optimal setting for this task, but it was
the one possible to implement with limited time.

# Results

Finally, in table [\[results\]](#results){reference-type="ref"
reference="results"} we present the results of all developed models,
tested with the ASSET and TurkCorpus datasets and trained with WikiLarge
or a subset of WikiAuto. For each model we report the SARI, BLEU and
FKGL metrics. Here, our best results were produced by BART with all the
tokens available in literature, plus the novel `n_syl` token.

We also observe disappointing results for T5-based models, especially
since it is the main ingredient for the current state-of-the-art system
[@sheang-saggion-2021-controllable]. Another interesting finding is that
CWI decreases the SARI score, while displaying the best FKGL score,
emphasizing the increased readability in detriment of meaning
preservation.

Furthermore, we only performed the hyperparameter search over the ASSET
dataset, which should imply that the token results for the TurkCorpus
dataset should be taken with a grain of salt and could substantially
improve. Plus, we disregarded testing all the features over the WikiAuto
trained model, since it's expected to perform worse than its WikiLarge
counterpart.

All in all, we got close to the sate-of-the-art with our best model
(BART+Tokens+n_syl) achieving a SARI of 43.05 which should only improve
with the suggestions from Future Work Section.

# Future work

Finally, after having identified some problems, bottlenecks or potential
areas of improvement impacting our system's performance, we will proceed
to briefly discuss them, in order to facilitate the continuation of our
work.

## BRIO-like training procedure

To begin, we have come across the BRIO
[@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2203.16804] model, that is currently
the state-of-the-art in abstractive summarization. Due to the similarity
between these two tasks, we think that replicating BRIO's properties
will substantially increase our model's performance.

The authors have introduced a novel training procedure that combines
contrastive loss and the regular MLE-based cross entropy loss we already
utilize. Particularly, the model utilizes the contrastive loss with the
assumption that text generation is not a \"one correct answer\" type of
task and thus, assigns probability mass to the supposedly suboptimal
candidate outputs.

As previously explained, BART-like models generate their candidate
sentences in a token-level autoregressive fashion, using beam-search to
limit the output space and, consequently, being able to generate several
candidates. Given the MLE assumption, the first output is the most
likely, since it produces a sentence similar to the provided reference.
On the other hand, this line of thought is flawed since other candidates
can be simple paraphrases, our desired outcome.

To combat this, the contrastive loss is based on an arbitrary metric
suitable to the task at hand (in our case, SARI). This novel training
procedure introduces the possibility of reordering the candidate
sentences according to their simplicity, directly coordinating with the
token-level generation task to improve the system's performance.

Furthermore, since we already investigated this ranking-type of approach
after the fine-tuning procedure, it is reasonable that incorporation
during training will improve our system.

## From Single Complex Words to Multi-Word Expressions

In addition to the CWI and replacement, a possible improvement would be
to also replace Multi-word Expressions (MWE) as they represent word sets
that should be treated as single lexical units.

Since MWEs are most of the time inherently complex, replacing them with
a single word synonym, if possible, could facilitate the TS task and
mark an improvement in our overall system as shown in both
@https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.05692 and
@gooding-etal-2020-incorporating.

## Replacement of Complex Words

As mentioned above, replacing complex words is our model's biggest
bottleneck, as it just accounts for the context and not for the word
itself. In naturally occurring sentences, it is completely ordinary for
antonyms or words meaning a different thing to be surrounded by the same
context (e.g. agreement and disagreement in legal texts), implying that
our approach is inherently flawed.

However, previous research we encountered
([@Biran-2011; @Qiang-etal-2020]) uses either a rule-based approach, or
a similar masking approach, implying that this is a research field left
to further explore. After some consideration, we thought that in a
future work setting, it might be worth it to explore modelling this
problem as an expression paraphrasing problem. Of course, this leads us
to the problem of having no suitable datasets.

Nonetheless, it might be possible to adapt current paraphrase datasets
by aligning each sentence pair at a token level, hopefully constructing
a dataset of expressions that have a similar meaning, while preserving
their context which may still be useful.

## Modelling inter-sentence dependencies

Finally, the vast majority of TS related research models the problem in
a sentence to sentence scenario. However, in real word applications it
is very useful to provide a document level simplification rather than on
a sentence level.

Consider, for example, legal text that should still be understood by
non-legal experts but is usually too complex and long: if we were to
simplify it at the sentence level, we would never achieve optimal
simplifications that stem from cutting largely irrelevant portions of
text. Thus, confirming that it might be useful to pursue the TS problem
from a different prism.

To this effect, @https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2110.05071 introduced a
new dataset D-Wikipedia that provides aligned articles in detriment of
aligned sentences, while also introducing a corresponding D-SARI metric,
formalizing this TS paradigm. Furthermore, by introducing several
baseline models, the authors proved there is some merit to this
approach.

Concluding, we should also relate this version of the problem with the
abstractive summarization one, which is so very similar. The only
additional constraint is that in document-level simplification, we
require the resulting sentences to be simple, possibly resulting in
larger outputs in order to express ideas which could be condensed
otherwise. Nevertheless, emulating successful summarization papers could
serve some purpose to this new paradigm.

# Explaining Kept Complex Words

As a sidenote that didn't get included in our final system: for words
that were to be replaced and had no simpler synonym, it could be useful
to include their definition in the produced simplification. To this
effect, we used PyDictionary, a Python library that relies on WordNet to
get word definitions. Including the meaning of the word is done in a
post-processing step and has no other effect on the system.

As expected, adding more text (even potentially complex text) produced a
poor SARI result. In table [3](#complex_word_def){reference-type="ref"
reference="complex_word_def"}, we present an example of this definition
incorporation procedure.

'methane' was identified as being complex. Since it does not have a
simpler synonym in WordNet, its definition was added to the source
sentence.

# Demonstration

Concluding, to go along with our presentation, we built an app using
Python and Streamlit in order to illustrate our system's capabilities.
This app is currently publicly available on a HuggingFace Spaces
page[^5] for easy user interaction.

Moreover, both the simplification model and the CWI regressor were made
public to the HuggingFace community, available with the names
`twigs/bart-text2text-simplifier` and `twigs/cwi-regressor`
respectively.
